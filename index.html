      <p>Hi Flatiron School!! I'm Matt Thorry: current science educator and aspiring software engineer. Born and raised in New Jersey, I'm an inquisitive and tenacious person, so coding and technology have always fascinated me. I've also been told I'm quite humorous and a fantastic listener. I'm pretty set on going to your school, hence the wonderful & responsive site I made using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and a dash of JavaScript.</p>
      <p>(Full disclosure: I'm totally trying to show off and I <em>really</em> hope it's working. <strong>Hover</strong> over the pictures for captions! Resize the page to watch it <em>shrink</em> and <strong>grow</strong>.)</p>

       <span id="imgDescription" style="left: -20%; top: 50px;">Me being cute. My siblings very safely rocking in the background.</span>
      </div>

      <p>I was born with a natural curiousity, wanting to know how and why the world worked. I loved natural disasters and dreamed of becoming a tornado chaser. Despite both working multiple jobs and being generally busy, my parents always supported my interests, helping me tape tornado shows on TV and giving me supplies to build beautiful sand castle cities on the beach which I would then destroy via ''flood'' or ''tsunami''. They didn't understand why I was so in love with disasters but they were excited it kept me out of real trouble.</p>

      </div>
      <p>As I got a little older, I began to excel in math and science as they quenched my thirst for knowledge. I also began to sense that I was <em>maybe</em> a little weird (but that might have been because my brother continuously pointed this out to me and everyone we knew). I loved making websites for random things like my dog or New Year's Eve using Angel Fire and I spent a lot of time with my best friend interpreting our dreams on <a href="http://www.dreammoods.com/" target="_blank">dreammoods.com</a>, so yeah, kinda weird.</p>
    </div>



    <div class="paragraph" id="hs">
      <h1>High School: Coming of Age</h1>
      <div class="imgWrap">
          <img src="img/yearbook.jpg" class="portrait pull-right"/>
          <span id="imgDescription" style="left: 75%; top: 75%;">Why wouldn't there be a typo? üòê</span>
      </div>
      <p>By high school I had gone full hermit. I knew I was gay <em>and</em> a nerd, so I felt it best to just stay quiet and fade into the background--keep the heat and attention off me. I kept working hard, getting good grades and even got a job to make some money. I also got really into personalizing my Xanga blog and MySpace page using HTML, even making my own banners with Photoshop! I enjoyed the beautiful hybrid of using technical and creative skills. However after a rough sophomore year of isolation, I realized hermit life was not sustainable. I got my lowest grade <em>ever:</em> an 83 in English and I was devastated. This was my wakeup call and I decided to get out and be social. It then became clear to me that people <em>actually</em> liked me and thought I was funny! Turned out that being a gay nerd was fine when you <strong>own</strong> it!</p>
      <p><em>Disclaimer: I fully understand that getting an 83 in English class does not constitute rock bottom but for me at the time it was. Did I mention I was also a little dramatic as a teen?</em></p>

      <h1>College & Finding My Place</h1>

        <span id="imgDescription" style="top: 10%; left: -5%">Chillin on a lava flow. VERY excited to cross that off the ol' bucket list.</span>
      </div>
      <p>My parents, God bless them, did not go to college and were completely hopeless in helping me with college applications. So, with no clue what I was doing I decided to ship across the country to the University of Arizona, where my cousin's husband went, because I wanted to experience something new. After saying bye to my parents, I was sitting alone in Newark Airport waiting to board the second flight I'd ever taken. I realized I was going to a place where I knew absolutely no one and was going to be thousands of miles away from everyone.</p>
      <p style="font-size: 24pt; font-weight: bolder; text-align: center;">WHAT AM I THINKING?? WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME?!</p>
      <p>Luckily, it turned out to be one of the best decisions I've ever made! Learning Earth Science, geology specifically, out west was an incredible experience. I got to learn from the best and brightest in my field. <em>But what to do with my degree?</em> Teaching seemed like a good option and then I wouldn't have to sell my soul to an oil company!</p>

      <h1>Mr. Thorry, Science Teacher</h1>
      <div class="imgWrap">
        <img src="img/classroom.jpg" class="pict pull-right" />
        <span id="imgDescription" style="left: 65%; top: 10%">I took this picture during orientation for work. It was the first time I saw my future classroom!</span>
      </div>
      <p>In May 2010 I graduated, by June I was hired by the New York City Dept of Education and in September I started teaching. At the ripe age of 22, I was suddenly responsible for over 100 students aged 15-18. Needless to say, I was totally unprepared.</p>
      <p>Luckily, again, I worked in a new school with lots of young and eager teachers so I was able to climb the steep learning curve with their help. By year three, I'd really hit my stride and felt great. Students were learning and my coworkers were amazing but trying to meet the needs of such diverse students was starting to take its toll, emotionally and physically.</p>
      <p>Thankfully, I've had the support of my family, friends and amazing boyfriend through the years. There is no way I could have taught this long without them! Oh, yeah--almost forgot to mention that I was also getting a Master's Degree while working full time which was an additional <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">challenge</span> <strong>learning opportunity</strong>! It was definitely not easy but I got to make cool German videos like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdBGDRZDyQw" target="_blank">this.</a></p>
      <p>Unfortunately education reform efforts have made teaching increasingly unenjoyable for me (and my students!), so I knew I needed to make a change. <em>But what?</em> The entire field of education seems to be tainted by so-called reform efforts that suck the joy out of education, so what's a boy to do?</p>

      <h1>Figuring out the Future</h1>
      <div class="imgWrap">
        <img src="img/iceland.jpg" class="portrait pull-right"/>
        <span id="imgDescription" style="left: 75%">I <em>only</em> travel to places that are geologically active. Not really, but I do often push for those trips üòé</span>
      </div>
      <p>Throughout my life, I always loved technology, however, to me these things seemed like a fun hobby--surely these were not useful skills. It wasn't until a few years ago when I started doing courses on Codecademy that I realized I'd been <em>coding</em> all along! That skill I kept hearing about that was super in demand and necessary for life in the 21st century was what I'd been doing when I was creating websites and personalizing my social media?!</p>
      <p>This is where <strong>you</strong> come in. I really love this stuff, especially front-end development, but I need help becoming a software engineer. I've spent a lot of my life trying to do things on my own, but after teaching for 7 years I've realized teamwork makes the dream work! Doing things solo is just silly!</p>
      <p>I hope you can see my tenacity and passion. I've never been afraid of a challenge, which this will most certainly be, but the payoff will be incredible. While I can be goofy, nothing has ever been handed to me and I've always had to work hard so I will bring that with me to your school. To have a job where I feel fulfilled and proud will be truly amazing so I'll do what it takes to get there. I know my dreams will come true with your help, so please give me a chance!</p>
